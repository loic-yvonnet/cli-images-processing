# Command line images processing

This repo is just a compilation a great command line tools to quickly convert and combine image files to PDF.
Just for later reference.

Shells:
* **init.sh**: it installs the dependencies and patches the ghostscript configuration
* **heic\_to\_pdf.sh**: it converts a set of HEIC files to a compressed PDF.
